# Project on indefinite hiatus due to upstream conflict
The ISO standard is unavailable until it has been published, at which point it will be expensive.

The BSI standard is an old version and incompatible with the new version.

The reference implementation is written in C, was last tested on Ubuntu 14, and has no documentation. There are no other official implementations; the typo-ridden website and Android app just compile the C code into themselves.

The only real option, at this point, is to read the thousands of lines of barely-documented C in lieu of a standard. As I am not willing to do that, this project is on hiatus until a standard becomes available. If you're good at reading C, feel free to write your own implementation or PR mine (or send me a message, if the archival doesn't let you PR).

The project is interesting. I wish it didn't have to be this way.
